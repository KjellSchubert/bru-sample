    # From https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1379 :
    # The default gcc & stdlib 4.6 as of January 2015, and C++11 sucks
    # with that old stdlib. Let's pull g++ >= 4.8's stdlib instead:
    - sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test -y
    - sudo apt-get update -qq
    - sudo apt-get install -qq g++-4.8
    - which g++
    - g++ --version
    # Note that even though this still reports g++ 4.6 clang will end up using
    # the 4.8 stdlib, solving the 4.6 issues with std::chrono and C++11 issues
    # in general.

    # set env vars needed by gyp for explicit compilation with clang
    # (since gcc will not be able to handle -fsanitize=address)

    # it doesnt really matter if you pull deps via 'bru install' during the
    # travis-ci install or script stage, but
    #   http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/build-configuration/
    # suggests the install stage for convention's sake. So let's install
    # upstream dependencies needed during C++ compilation now, e.g.
    # googletest, protobuf, ... Not that pulling deps here implies getting
    # the tar.gz for these modules unpacked, running ./configure for some of 
    # them, but not building them yet. Not that this matters a lot.

script:
    # build & run quick tests for upstream dependencies. These are the tests
    # as specified in bru:library/protobuf_and_such/*.gyp.
    # Since this steps builds all targets in ./*gyp it will also build the test
    # app's own cpp files in ./src
    - bru test

    # (exactly the same lines can compute test cov for any *.gyp project).
